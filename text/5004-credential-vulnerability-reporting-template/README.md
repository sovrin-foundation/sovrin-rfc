# 5004: Credential Vulnerability Reporting Template
- Authors: Dan Gisolfi, Daniel Hardman
- Status Date: 2019-09-01

Sovrin prefers to engage with security researchers and ethical hackers using a responsible disclosure policy with respect to its credential technology. If you become aware of a vulnerability in Sovrin's credential implementation, or in the practices or technologies used by an issuer or verifier of Sovrin credentials, please let us know by filling out the template below, and emailing it to security@sovrin.org. We will work with you to get it fixed.

### Please refer to our general threat model for Sovrin credentials, as published in [Aries RFC 0207](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0207-credential-fraud-threat-model/README.md). That model defines some useful terminology and helps us recognize common patterns in vulnerabilities..

### User Story
*Describe your concern by describing a user story that depicts the potential for identity fraud in  plain english. You can incorporate interaction diagrams if desired. The goal here is to clearly describe the problem using a story based example.*

Example:
>
1. Alice's Bank requires proof of address.
2. Alice presents Bank with a credential containing Address data.
3. Bank is not confident that Alice received the credential from a trusted Issuer.  


### Problem Statement

**Concern**: 

*Using the stakeholders of ISUER, HOLDER and  VERIFIER describe the fraud risk that is in question.*

Example:

>How does the VERIFIER know that HOLDER received the signed address data from a trusted ISSUER?  

**Challenge**: 

*What is the abstract question that needs to be answered?*

Example:

>What assurances does the VERIFIER have that HOLDER received presented data from a trusted ISSUER? 

**Fraud Dimensions**:

*Answer the multidimensional questions outline in [Aries RFC 0207](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0207-credential-fraud-threat-model/README.md).

Example:

>
1. Who is the perpetrator of the fraud? *fake-issuer*
2. Who is directly deceived?  *fool-holder*
3. When is the deception committed? *issuance-time*
4. Where (on which fact) is the deception focused? *bad-issuer-identity*

**Fraud Multidimensional Context**: 

*If this hypothetical situation is possible, how do we prevent it? If it is not possible, we should be able to clearly articulate the measures taken to prevent it.*

Example:

>
   fake-issuer + fool-holder + issuance-time + bad-issuer-identity


### Questions

*Use this section to provide complimentary questions to aid in the understanding of the problem/challenge.*
